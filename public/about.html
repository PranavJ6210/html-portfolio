<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Myself a one leg man. I go by the name Haridhraa Pranav. Born in the south of India, Tamil Nadu, I am basically very friendly, but I still prefer to be lonely when I feel down (Very little social juice LOL!).</p>

<p>Currently being educated in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Sri Ramakrishna Engineering college is my educator. Love the community of students (Very kind people man) and staff here (although this is scare. No offense :P) </p>

<p>What do I love to do?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Travel alot in Motobikes (Interceptor 650 is what I love)</li>
  <li>Learning something new everyday (This world amazes me in every aspect NGL)</li>
  <li>To help others as best as I can (That is what gives me actual happiness)</li>
  <li>Be a better human (Thorfinn's Words, means I love watching Anime that gives life some sense)</li>

</ul>
